## How to report vulnerability

If you find a potential vulnerability in Vertex, please inform us of [robotsvision.vx@gmail.com]. I call for confidentiality until a correction is developed.

## Consideration of messages

1. Upon receipt of a message about vulnerability, I immediately proceed to its assessment.
2. I am working on the development of correction and coordination of its release.
3. After the release of correction, we inform the community about the problem and thank the researcher.

## Gratitude

I thank everyone who contributes to the security of our project. Your work is valued.
